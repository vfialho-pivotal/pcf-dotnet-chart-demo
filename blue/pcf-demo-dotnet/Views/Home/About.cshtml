    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Simple DotNet.Highcharts application with fixed-frequency updates. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        The application index and ip:port are shown in the lower-left corner. 
        This is useful as it illustrates round-robin scheduling in a single view.
        The "Kill App" button (also lower-left) will kill an application instance. 
        If multiple instances are deployed, the application index update will reflect 
        only the remaining instances in round-robin fashion.  Once the killed instances 
        are restarted, all instances will be seen in the update.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Environment" view will display all environment variables. 
        Note that any bound services are shown in the VCAP_SERVICES segment.
    </p>
    <p>
        A demo ups is bound only to show the binding in VCAP_SERVICES. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Open several clients to drive monitoring and auto-scaling.
